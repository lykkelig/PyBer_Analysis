# Module 5 - PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of Project
This challenge used 2 CSV files, city_data and ride_data. The goal is to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Analysis Jupyter notebook
* [Atomic:] In the Jupyter notebook we read in both files and then computed total fare by city type and plotted the summary data as a line graph. 

## Summary  Graph Interpretation
* [Atomic:] The graph does show some variation based on the month: https://github.com/lykkelig/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Fare_by_City_Type.png . Overall we can conclude that total fares is the hihest in urban cities and lowest in rural cities.
